building a chatbot using Python


Chatbot
The Streamlit conversational bot is designed to create an interactive web application where users can input text queries and receive responses generated by Google's Gemini AI language model. Here's a theoretical overview of how it works:

1.	API Key Authentication:

  	      o	The application requires an API key to authenticate requests to Google's Gemini AI service. This key ensures that only authorized users can access the model.

3.	Model Configuration:

  o	The Gemini AI language model is configured using the provided API key. This setup involves initializing a chat session with the model, which will handle the conversation history and generate responses based on user input.

4.	User Interface Setup:

  o	The application interface is built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating web applications. Streamlit provides an easy-to-use framework for adding interactive elements like text input fields and buttons.

4.	User Input Handling:

  o	The application includes an input field where users can type their questions or queries. This input is captured and processed when the user submits it by clicking a button.

5.	Generating Responses:

  o	Upon submission, the user's query is sent to the Gemini AI model. The model processes the input and generates a response, which can be streamed back to the application in real-time. This streaming capability allows for more interactive and dynamic response handling.

7.	Displaying Responses:

o	The generated response from the model is displayed on the application interface. If the response is streamed in chunks, each chunk is displayed as it is received, providing a smooth and continuous output to the user.



8.	Maintaining Conversation History:

  o	The application maintains a history of the conversation. This history can be displayed to the user, providing context and continuity for the ongoing interaction.

9.	Interactive User Experience:

  o	The combination of real-time input handling, dynamic response generation, and interactive display elements creates a responsive and engaging user experience. Users can iteratively input queries and receive answers, making the interaction feel like a natural conversation.


Imports and Setup

1.)	Importing Libraries:
    import streamlit as st
      
      o	Streamlit: This library is used to create web applications easily.
  
    import os
        
        o	OS: This module helps interact with the operating system. Here, we use it to set environment variables.

    import pathlib
    
    import textwrap
    
      o	Pathlib and Textwrap: These are imported but not used in the code. They can be removed to clean up the code.
        from IPython.display import display, Markdown
      
      o	IPython Display: These are used to display rich content (like Markdown) in IPython environments. Not used in the code.
        Configuring API Key


2.	Setting the API Key:

    os.environ['GEMINI_API_KEY'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'

  	o	This sets an environment variable named GEMINI_API_KEY with your Google Generative AI API key. Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' with your actual API key.


Configuring and Initializing Generative AI


4.	Importing and Configuring Google Generative AI:

  import google.generativeai as genai
  
    o	This imports the Google Generative AI library.
  
  genai.configure(api_key=os.environ['GEMINI_API_KEY'])
    
    o	This configures the Google Generative AI library to use the API key we set earlier.


4.	Initializing the Model and Chat:

  model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro')
    
    o	This initializes the Generative AI model named 'gemini-pro'.
  
  chat = model.start_chat(history=[])
    
    o	This starts a new chat session with an empty history. The history parameter is used to maintain a conversation context.
Function to Get AI Response



5.	Defining the Function to Get AI Response:

  def get_gemini_response(question):
    
    o	This defines a function named get_gemini_response that takes a question as input.

  response = chat.send_message(question, stream=True)
    
    o	This sends the question to the AI model and streams the response. Streaming means the response is received in parts (chunks).

return response
  o	This returns the AI's response.



Initializing Streamlit App


6.	Setting Up the Streamlit App:

  st.set_page_config(page_title="CONVERSATIONAL BOT")
  
    o	This sets the page title of the Streamlit app to "CONVERSATIONAL BOT".
  
  st.header("Gemini AI LLM")
  
  o	This sets a header in the Streamlit app with the text "Gemini AI LLM".


User Input and Button


7.	Creating User Input and Button:

  input = st.text_input("Input: ", key="input")
  
    o	This creates a text input field where users can type their questions. The key="input" uniquely identifies this input field.
  
  submit = st.button("Answer to your question")
    
    o	This creates a button labeled "Answer to your question". When clicked, it triggers the AI response.



Handling Button Click


8.	Handling the Button Click:
if submit:
o	This checks if the submit button has been clicked.
response = get_gemini_response(input)
o	If the button is clicked, it calls the get_gemini_response function with the user's input and stores the response.
st.subheader("The Response is")
o	This adds a subheader in the Streamlit app with the text "The Response is".
for chunk in response:
o	This loops through each chunk of the streamed response.
st.write(chunk.text)
o	This writes each chunk of the response text to the Streamlit app.
print("_" * 80)
o	This prints a separator line in the console. It helps in debugging to see where each response ends.
st.write(chat.history)
o	This writes the chat history to the Streamlit app, showing the previous conversation context.


Notes
•	Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE':
o	Ensure you replace 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' with your actual Google Generative AI API key.
•	Remove Unused Imports:
o	You can remove the pathlib and textwrap imports to clean up the code since they are not used.
•	Installing Necessary Packages:
o	Make sure you have the required packages installed. You can install them using:
pip install streamlit google-generativeai
This code sets up a simple conversational bot using Streamlit for the web interface and Google's Generative AI for generating responses. When the user inputs a question and clicks the button, the app fetches and displays the AI's response.
Working Procedure: 
1)	Create Virtual environment  py -m venv myenv
2)	Activate the Virtual Environment  go to myenv\Scripts and  write activate command here and press enter. Then our virtual envirornment will be activated.
3)	Install required Libraries Mentioned Above
4)	After that I Wrote a program for chatbot and saved it with chat.py
5)	Open command prompt and go to chat.py location.
6)	Run the chat.py file using this command  streamlit run chat.py
7)	First time it will ask mail id.. please enter valid mail id
8)	After that it will open any one browser and it displays with Gemini Ai Bot.
9)	Now you can write your query here and gemini ai bot will give us result.
